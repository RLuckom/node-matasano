An attempt at the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) in Nodejs.

This project uses ES6 compiled to JS by Babel 6.

To build:

Install Node 5.x

in the root directory, run

There may be other dependencies that I've installed globally that I didn't add
to the package.json. If you run into problems please open an issue.
